# Standard Notes Syncing Server

#### Please note: We will be transitioning the codebase from Ruby and Ruby on Rails to TypeScript and JavaScript. After that is complete, the setup guide below will be upated accordingly. 

You can run your own Standard Notes server and use it with any Standard Notes app. This allows you to have 100% control of your data. This server is built with Ruby on Rails and can be deployed in minutes.

**Requirements**

- Docker

**Data persistency**

Your MySQL Data will be written to your local disk in the `data` folder to keep it persistent between server runs.

### Getting started

1. Clone the project:

	```
	git clone --branch master https://github.com/standardnotes/syncing-server.git
	```

1. Setup the server by running:
```
./server.sh setup
```

1. Run the server by typing:
```
./server.sh start
```

Your server should now be available under http://localhost:3000

### Logs

You can check the logs of the running server by typing:

```
./server.sh logs
```

### Stopping the Server

In order to stop the server type:
```
./server.sh stop
```

### Updating to latest version

In order to update to the latest version of our software please first stop the server and then type:

```

```

### Checking Status

You can check the status of running services by typing:

```

### Tests

The `syncing-server` uses [RSpec](http://rspec.info) for tests.

To execute all of the test specs, run the following command at the root of the project directory:

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```

Code coverage report is available within the `coverage` directory.
